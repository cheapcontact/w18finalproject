Core Questions: <br/>
“What could this bike sharing business do with this data?” <br/>
Overall bike usage <br/>
Subscriber routine <br/>
Customer routine <br/>
Bike wear-and-tear <br/>
Migration behavior <br/>
Do stations run out of bikes? Have too much of a surplus? <br/>
Does the bike company need to shuttle bikes around to make sure each station is balanced appropriately? <br/>
When do riders go over 30 minutes? (Premium time frame) <br/>
What impact does weather make? <br/>
Are there times when it makes sense to shut down specific stations? <br/>
How does usage change? “Do we make more money due to extended trips?” <br/>
Do special events radically change business? How to accommodate? <br/>
Business data <br/>
Where do subscribers come from? <br/>
Should the company try other timing/pricing models to increase bike usage? Or to deal with peak hours? Should there be surge pricing? <br/>
Do other businesses impact how people use bicycles? (Trader Joes/Whole Foods) <br/>
Did a new company or a lapsed company impact behavior in any way? <br/>
Is there a time in the day where we should surge charge? Is 30 minutes the correct amount of time for both bicyclists and the business? <br/>
Behavioral change over time -- did this happen? Did it impact the business? <br/>
Are there investments the business should make based on this data? <br/>
Should they build more stations?  <br/>
Should they have less stations?  <br/>
Are the locations correctly placed? <br/>
Is there data the business is missing that could give it more agency over growth and success? <br/>
