Core Questions:
“What could this bike sharing business do with this data?”
Overall bike usage
Subscriber routine
Customer routine
Bike wear-and-tear
Migration behavior
Do stations run out of bikes? Have too much of a surplus?
Does the bike company need to shuttle bikes around to make sure each station is balanced appropriately?
When do riders go over 30 minutes? (Premium time frame)
What impact does weather make?
Are there times when it makes sense to shut down specific stations?
How does usage change? “Do we make more money due to extended trips?”
Do special events radically change business? How to accommodate?
Business data
Where do subscribers come from?
Should the company try other timing/pricing models to increase bike usage? Or to deal with peak hours? Should there be surge pricing?
Do other businesses impact how people use bicycles? (Trader Joes/Whole Foods)
Did a new company or a lapsed company impact behavior in any way?
Is there a time in the day where we should surge charge? Is 30 minutes the correct amount of time for both bicyclists and the business?
Behavioral change over time -- did this happen? Did it impact the business?
Are there investments the business should make based on this data?
Should they build more stations? 
Should they have less stations? 
Are the locations correctly placed?
Is there data the business is missing that could give it more agency over growth and success?
